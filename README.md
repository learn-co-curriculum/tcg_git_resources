# More Git Resources

## Learning Goals

- Explain the git model

## Resources

To advance beyond using the basic git interface and feel more confident in your git use, you need to build a model of git in your head that matches git's data model. These resources can help you build a deeper model of git in your head.

Read the following guides and posts:

- [Visual Git Guide](http://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html)
- [Git Commands, Visualized with D3js](http://onlywei.github.io/explain-git-with-d3/)
- [Building a git visualizer in node and react](https://ksylor.github.io/2018/10/06/getting-restarted.html)

And run the [Git Live View](https://github.com/ksylor/git-live-view) tool locally.

All together, these posts and tools should take about 2 hours to get through. Do them one by one.
